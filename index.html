        <h2>What Am I Seeing?</h2>
        <p>
          This simulation visualizes a basic concept in physics: a
          <strong>U(1) field</strong> on a 2D grid. Think of it like a field of
          tiny compass needles that can point in any direction on a circle. The
          system naturally wants to minimize its energy, which causes neighboring
          arrows to align, leading to the fascinating patterns and ordering you
          observe.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <h4>Q: What are the arrows? Are they particles?</h4>
        <p>
          The arrows represent the fundamental <strong>U(1) field</strong>
          itself, not particles. At every point in space, the field has a value
          (its phase or angle). Particles, like electrons or positrons, would
          emerge as stable, swirling patterns *in* this field, known as
          <strong>vortices</strong> (🌀), which you might see forming as defects
          when the system orders itself.
        </p>

        <h4>Q: How do the arrows know how to line up?</h4>
        <p>
          The simulation respects the circular nature (U(1) symmetry) of the
          arrows' phase. To find the direction an arrow "wants" to point, we
          don't just average the angles of its neighbors numerically. Instead, we
          treat each neighbor's direction as a vector, add all those vectors
          together, and find the angle of the resulting sum.
        </p>
        <pre><code>// Convert angles to vectors
let avgX = 0;
let avgY = 0;
for (const angle of neighbors) {
  avgX += Math.cos(angle);
  avgY += Math.sin(angle);
}
// Find angle of the sum vector
const targetAngle = Math.atan2(avgY, avgX);
</code></pre>
        <p>
          This correctly handles the "wrap-around" nature of the circle – it's
          like spinning a wheel multiple times and seeing where the final mark
          lands (🛞). This vector averaging is the core logic driving the
          alignment.
        </p>

        <h4>Q: Why does it order itself even with zero temperature?</h4>
        <p>
          The drive towards order comes from minimizing the system's internal
          energy, not from temperature. A random, chaotic state is high-energy
          because many neighboring arrows are misaligned. The alignment rule
          naturally reduces this "tension." Temperature (the random kicks)
          actually disrupts this process but also helps "melt" defects (like
          vortices) that get frozen in during rapid ordering.
        </p>

        <h4>Q: Does the temperature slider correctly model physics?</h4>
        <p>
          Not perfectly. The random "kicks" we add violate a deeper principle
          called <strong>local gauge symmetry</strong>. In real physics (like
          electromagnetism), changes must be accounted for locally – phase can't
          just appear, it has to "flow" as part of a transaction. A more
          accurate simulation would introduce temperature via the spontaneous
          creation and annihilation of balanced vortex/anti-vortex pairs,
          conserving phase locally.
        </p>

        <h4>Q: What key physics is this simulation *missing*?</h4>
        <p>
          It's missing the strict local "accounting" mechanism enforced by
          <strong>gauge symmetry</strong>. This mechanism requires a "gauge
          field" (like the electromagnetic field) that lives on the connections
          *between* the arrows and ensures phase is conserved in every
          interaction. This local enforcement is what gives rise to
          force-carrying particles (<strong>gauge bosons</strong>, like the
          photon 💡) which are absent here. This simulation shows the field, but
          not the force governing its interactions in a locally symmetric way.
